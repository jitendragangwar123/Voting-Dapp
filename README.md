# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

```
//install the docker
sudo apt  install docker.io
//show all container
sudo docker ps -a
//show all images
sudo docker image ls
//to build the image
sudo docker build -t jitendra/voting-dapp .
//to run the image
sudo docker run -p 3000:3000 jitendra/voting-dapp
```
